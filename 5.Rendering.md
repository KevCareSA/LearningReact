### **What is rendering?**

Put simply, rendering is just a fancy way of saying that React calls your ~~function~~ component with the intent of eventually updating the UI.

React rendering is the process of displaying your user interface (UI) on the screen.

1. **Components:**
These are the building blocks of your UI. They're JavaScript functions or classes that describe a part of your interface.
2. **Initial Render:**
When your app starts, React takes all your components and creates a tree-like structure of them.
3. **Virtual DOM:**
React creates a lightweight JavaScript representation of your actual DOM (Document Object Model). This is faster to work with than the real DOM.
4. **Updating the Real DOM:**
React then uses this virtual representation to update the actual DOM that the user sees in the browser.
5. **Re-rendering:**
When data in your app changes (like when a user clicks a button), React doesn't immediately update the DOM. Instead, it:
    - Creates a new virtual DOM with the updated data
    - Compares this new virtual DOM with the previous one
    - Calculates the differences (called "diffing")
    - Updates only the changed parts in the real DOM
6. **Component Lifecycle:**
Each component goes through a series of stages from when it's created to when it's removed.
React provides methods to hook into these stages.

This process allows React to update UIs efficiently, leading to better performance in web applications.

When React renders a component, two things happen:

- First, React creates a snapshot of your component which **captures** everything React needs to update the view
at that particular moment in time. **props**, **state**, **event handlers**, and a **description of the UI** (based on those props and state)
are all captured in this snapshot.

From there, React takes that description of the UI and uses it to update the View.
