# Learning React


Creating notes on React.js and sharing them on GitHub is a great way to document your learning process and help others who are studying the same topic. Hereâ€™s how you can structure your README for React.js notes:

### 1. **Title**

   - Learning React

   ```markdown
   # React.js Study Notes
   ```

### 2. **Introduction**
   ```
   These are my study notes on [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), covering core concepts, components, hooks, state management, and more. These notes are intended to help beginners understand React.js and serve as a reference for those looking to refresh their knowledge.

   ```markdown
   ## Getting Started
   React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.

   ## Components
   Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based. Each component encapsulates a part of the user interface.

   ### Functional Components
   Functional components are basic JavaScript functions that return JSX.

   ```jsx
   function Welcome() {
     return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
   }
   ```

   ### Class Components
   Class components allow you to use more features, like state and lifecycle methods.

   ```jsx
   class Welcome extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
     }
   }
   ```

   ## JSX
   JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without using `createElement()` or `appendChild()`.

   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
   ```

   ## State and Props
   State and props are key concepts in React.js. Props are inputs to components and are read-only, while state represents dynamic data that changes over time.
   ```
